# ML-Model-for-Customer-Retention

In this project, I will find the best model to assist Beta Bank in promoting more customer retention. Beta Bank already has a strong dataset with each observation being of one customer. The features of the dataset are all the key identifying characteristics of each customer and the target is 'Exited' - whether or not the customer has left. 

**Original Dataset:** <br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/911c320f-4e01-4bba-b6e0-8cf696749037)
First feature is cut off-RowNumber 

**Features** <br>
There are many irrelevant features in this dataset that were removed before training the models

**Target**<br>

Exited — сustomer has left<br> 
0 = NO <br>
1 = YES

**Machine Learning Model:**

I'll be testing out three models for this project: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression because they are simple models that work well with classification tasks.

After training each model with the user behavioral data, I'll check their quality using the test dataset.
